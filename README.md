Task1:- Calulate factorial using a function
    Explanation:- In this code we define a function named fact, this fucntion is the fuction that is used to do the factorial of a number.
    Now in the fucntion we have declared a variable called num, then the num is explisitly convered into an integer
    and then using if, elif and else block we give the final answer, first we give say that the factorial is not possible for anything that is less than
    zero, and factorial for zero is 1 and then for other numbers is displayed on the terminal.

Task2:- Using the Math Module for calculations
        Explanation:- In this code we import the math functions, and then we input a number and using fstring fucntions, to print the 
        square root, logarithm and sine of the give number.
